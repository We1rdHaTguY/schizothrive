     <p>
      I decided to harness ChatGPT today to help me come up with a simple and easy vegetable soup recipe that I can make <b><em>using mostly canned goods.</em></b> I'm no chef, so ChatGPT and other AI chat bots are of great use to me for coming up with proper ingredients and portions. 
      I’ve been looking for a simple way to incorporate more veggies into my current diet that aren’t raw because I’ve done the raw vegan thing a long time ago and it made me feel great at the time except for one thing; it gave me serious constipation. 
      My current diet isn’t a vegan diet, but I’m straying away from carb-loaded foods like baked goods, pastries, pasta, sugary sweets, in favor of whole food options, and I try to moderate my intake of meat enough that I’m not solely relying on meat as a replacement for carb-loaded options. 
      I also wanted to increase my intake of important nutrients and felt like a veggie soup would be the perfect fit as something tasty that will mostly satisfy those needs.<br ><br >Below is the recipe I came up with for myself with the help of ChatGPT that will make about 4-6 servings (depending on whether you’re having it as a main dish or a side dish, I like to store it away for another 3-4 reheatable dishes throughout the week) for around $10:&#xa0;
     </p>
     <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>
       <li>1 can mixed vegetables (drained and rinsed)</li>
       <li>1 can corn (drained and rinsed)</li>
       <li>1 can green beans (drained and rinsed)</li>
       <li>1 can potatoes (diced, drained) or 1 cup frozen diced potatoes</li>
       <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li><li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
       <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning (or a mix of thyme, oregano, and basil)</li>
      </ul>
     <div class="info-card">
      <b>Optional Ingredients:</b>
       <ul>
        <li>1–2 tbsp olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
       </ul>
     </div>
     <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
       <li><u>Sauté onion and garlic:</u><br>
        In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook for 3-5 minutes.</li>
       <li><u>Add Canned Veggies & tomatoes:</u><br>
        Dump in the diced tomatoes (with juice) and all veggies.</li>
       <li><u>Add broth and seasoning:</u><br>
        Pour in the broth and stir in your spices. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
       <li><u>Simmer:</u><br>
        Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes to let flavors meld. Stir occasionally. Add in spinach about 5 minutes before finishing.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In my first batch I’m going to use 1 tbsp of butter, a pinch of red pepper, and spinach as my optional ingredients. 
      I won’t be using onion or garlic, so I can skip the first step, making it about a 15-20 minute meal to cook. 
      I’m also going to use raw potatoes instead of canned and I’ll be using vegetable cooking stock instead of broth only because where I shop has a limited selection. 
      I’m cooking this up only for myself though, so I won’t just get a single meal out of it, I’ll get another 3-5 meals I can store away and reheat on the stove or in the microwave. 
      For roughly $10, that’s really not a bad deal at all! (Especially in this economy). 
      I’ll share my results and whether or not I’ll be making tweaks to the recipe in another post. Thanks for comin’!
