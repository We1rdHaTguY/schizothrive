     <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
     <p>
      I've always found the idea of hive-minds interesting. After all, there are species of bees and ants that we know act as hive-minds.
      What is a hive-mind exactly you might be asking? A hive-mind is basically all the minds of a species (or colony) working together as a single mind.
      I'm sure there would be plenty of peoople who would laugh at the idea or say it's impossible for the human species to be a hive-mind, but this is where I'm a little more open to the concept.
     </p>
     <h3 id="grandlibraryofexperience">The Grand Library of Experience</h3>
     <p>
      When I think about how a hive-mind could possibly work, I imagine it to be a giant library of experiences past and present that comes from every human mind on the planet.
      Have you ever heard of remote viewing, for example? <b><em>There have been studies conducted where they were able to train people to remotely view an area through the senses of someone else.</em></b>
      A scary thought maybe, but the hive-mind theory in my opinion would explain this along with many other psychic phenomena pretty well.<br><br>
      The question I ask myself is, <b><em>is it possible that we're capable of seeing other's experiences through some kind of wireless communication of the mind?</em></b>
      Then I went even further and asked, what if that's one of the primary purposes of the pineal gland? <b><em>Maybe the pineal gland could be a possible "antenna" that can connect to any human mind</em></b> and acquire new knowledge remotely.
      Maybe a lot of us just never knew how to make use of it. Hell, maybe it was something that was needed at a much earlier time in our evolution but we forgot how to use it because we don't need it as much as we did then.
     </p>
     <h3 id="onelivingthing">Are We All Actually One Living Thing?</h3>
     <p>
      Alright, maybe we're skidding a little too far into schizo-land here, but I think you get the point. It's an interesting topic nonetheless! <b><em>I think it could explain some things like some vivid dreams, premonitions, intrusive thoughts, remote viewing, out of body experiences, empaths, etc.</em></b>
      There's a lot that would fit the bill. And now imagine for a second if every species and/or colony on the planet was it's own hive-mind. We'd be just one of many hive-minds.<br><br>
      I personally like to look at <b><em>each human-being as being a single expression of the entire human race in the same way that every cell in our bodies is a single expression of our DNA.</em></b>
      The only difference for us though is that we're not all physically bound to each like the cells of our body are, but <b><em>we could all essentially be a part of one giant living thing like our cells are.</em></b>
     </p>
     <h3 id="selfharm">Hurting Someone Else Is Hurting Yourself</h3>
     <p>
      Now if you think about it in this way for a minute, if we're all a part of the same living thing, from that perspective that would mean <b><em>when you physically or emotionally hurt another human being you're actually hurting yourself at the same time you just don't immediately realize it.</em></b>
      That was a somewhat profound realization I had watching one of Bill MaxVoxPax's mental health check-in videos. I highly recommend his YouTube Channel, especially for his ASMR videos, he has a uniquely good voice for it.<br><br>
      He made a great point that <b><em>when someone causes you pain, it's good to remember that it came from a place of pain</em></b> as a way to hold compassion
      and understanding for those who have treated you or other people poorly. <b><em>They're not acting from a place of a totally healthy mind.</em></b> When I first heard this, it kind of cleared up the sky for me a bit, if you will.
     </p>
     <h3 id="religionsciencespirituality">From Religious, To Scientific, To Spiritual</h3>
     <p>
      Not that I want to dispel anyone's personal beliefs about "God", I'm pretty open minded to spiritual and religious beliefs these days, much more than I was when I was younger. I believe in freedom of religion even if other people's beliefs don't match mine and this includes atheism.
      However, I don't believe in imposing beliefs and making judgements upon others based on what they believe spiritually or non-spiritually and again this includes atheism.<br><br>
      I was spiritual and more religious when I was in my early teens, then over time I became a strong atheist as I found
      an interest in science and mathematics and had a natural knack for them. Back then I was much more judgemental of those who were religious and had strong opinions against religion, mostly of the organized kind. As the years passed though, <b><em>I couldn't help but have my own personal experiences that I truly couldn't explain
      to anyone without them looking at me like I'm crazy</em></b> (I mean technically speaking, from a psychiatric perspective, I am a bit crazy after all, hah!)<br><br>
      <b><em>I've had many things happen to me where things seemed to "synch up" in an almost perfectly "religious" or personally "meaningful" fashion,</em></b>
      like as though the Universe intended for me to receive a message. Many people would argue that these kind of experiences are simply our subconscious finding patterns that "aren't really there" and while I've certainly written off many things in my past as just that, <b><em>there have been circumstances
      that would be really hard to argue that point with some of the strings of coincidences I've experienced.</em></b> Some would seem almost impossible to be such a sequence of coincidences and would have a very strong impact on me emotionally and thoughtfully, really pushing me to reconsider the
      possibilities.
     </p>
     <h3 id="conflictingbeliefs">My Struggle Between Seemingly Conflicting Beliefs</h3>
     <p>
      Throughout my 20s <b><em>I was very adiment about writing off such experiences as something scientifically explainable with a bit of a dismissive attitude,</em></b> not considering possible meaning in seemingly paranormal things or strange occurrences I or others experienced.
      As I got older and older and I would end up in the psychiatric facility against my will more and more often though, <b><em>strange and paranormal occurrences became more and more frequent and much more difficult to explain away,</em></b> especially when things seemed to "synch up". You could argue that maybe
      that's my schizoaffective or bipolar disorder talking (they both include grandiose delusions while schizoaffective includes paranoia.)<br><br>
      But in any case, whether my experiences were induced by my disorders or not, <b><em>I personally find myself having to consider alternative possibilites just to keep
      myself from getting lost in the grandiose delusions I experience, whether I'd like to or not.</em></b> This ended up creating a difficult struggle within myself between looking at things from the perspective of science and math and what's objectively provable and the perspective of religion and spirituality or what we might call
      subjective experience. <b><em>I eventually had a breakthrough though after slowly being subjected to the ideas of quantum field theory</em></b> over the years <b><em>where measurements of objective reality have been known to change simply by our observation of them.</em></b>
     </p>
     <h3 id="invisibleinfluence">An Invisible Electromagnetic Influence Between Life-forms</h3>
     <p>
      A documentary called "I Am" about the struggles director Tom Shadyac (responsible for Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, and Bruce Almighty most notably) went through with
      clinical depression after getting a concussion from a bike riding accident, was one of the first to introduce me to these ideas. <b><em>A particular scene</em></b> in the movie <b><em>struck me as profound</em></b> when they placed electrodes on a yogurt yeast culture in a dish with Tom Shadyac sitting in front of it. <b><em>They asked him to think of something
      that stresses him out</em></b> at which point he says "I should call my lawyer right now". <b><em>At that very moment the needle gauge that the electrodes were hooked up to spiked to it's max reading briefly.</em></b> This happened a couple more times as he explored some of his other stressors.<br><br>
      This suggests that other <b><em>life-forms around us can be affected
      simply by the emotional spikes caused by our thoughts and perspectives.</em></b> At the very least, it suggests much more insignificant life-forms are greatly affected by our spikes of emotion when we're in their presence. <b><em>It makes one wonder though if the same could be said for emotional spikes in the presence of other humans.</em></b>
      Perhaps this could explain those who describe themselves as empaths or those who pick up on vibes of a person or place stronger than most.
     </p>
     <h3 id="sciencevsreligion">The Merging Of Science And Religion</h3>
     <p>
      Now a movie that really gave me a breakthrough though is <b><em>a documentary called "Black Whole" where a self-taught physicist and mathematician named Nassim Haramein</em></b> who went from living and doing his studies in a van to causing
      a real shakeup in the world of physics and math, <b><em>proves mathematically that there is a remarkable, repeatable pattern</em></b> between all finite structures in the Universe, <b><em>from everything down to the planck</em></b> (the smallest known "vibration" or "particle" of the Universe at that time), <b><em>to the entire Universe itself.</em></b> The important disctinction he made though
      was that <b><em>the Universe seems to have both finite structure</em></b> (the measurable boundaries of our existence) <b><em>and infinite information</em></b> (what religion and spirituality tend to view as infinite potential).<br><br>
      To have a better understanding of this concept, I suggest you <b><em>check out a "Mandelbrot Zoom" video on YouTube.</em></b> A nickname given by some for the "Mandelbrot Zoom" is "God's Fingerprint".
      To simplify a complex subject, <b><em>we can break anything down infinitely into smaller and smaller pieces of a "whole" and vice versa. We can infinitely zoom out to see a bigger and bigger "whole".</em></b> I mean it makes a lot of sense if you really think about it. You could easily argue that our solar system is simply a super-complex version of an atom or the next "octave up" of an atom if you will.
      After all, it's made up entirely of atoms at a much more basic level.
     </p>
     <h3 id="structuraloctaves">The Structural "Octaves" Of Objective Reality</h3>
     <p>
      In music, <b><em>an "octave" is simply a higher or lower pitch/frequency of the same note</em></b>ꟷa higher "octave" of an A note is still an A note, it's just a higher pitch version of the same thing. From this perspective, <b><em>you could argue that our reality has different "octaves" of structure</em></b> becoming more and more complex the higher the octave and becoming more and
      more basic the lower the octave (or perhaps it's the other way around, who knows?) <b><em>Infinite "octaves" of structure, finite boundaries of each "octave".</em></b> In this way, this would seem to give credence to the idea that <b><em>everything is really just one giant thing that's made up of smaller and smaller constituents,</em></b> something that bleeds over into spiritual philosophy (e.g. "Everything Is One", "We Are One", etc.)<br><br>
      Although Nassim goes into complex subjects of how we could possibly be the "event horizon" of a black hole, meaning we ourselves are actually existing inside of a black hole, <b><em>the main theme that he was trying to portray was that Science and Religion, in fact, overlap in some ways</em></b> and that they're both basically describing the same thing from different perspectives. <b><em>He was attempting to show
      how the two merge.</em></b>
     </p>
     <h3 id="wearetheexception">We Are Truly The Exception To The Universe</h3>
     <p>
      Probably <b><em>one of the most profound statements</em></b> from Nassim in "Black Whole" is that <b><em>everything down to the atomic structure is made up of 99.99999...% space</em></b> and that <b><em>matter is only a tiny fraction of a fraction of a fraction... etc. of a percent of everything that exists</em></b> in the Universe.
      The Universe is mostly space. <b><em>We are</em></b> (or rather, all matter is) <b><em>the unlikely exception to the Universe to the absolute extreme.</em></b> This alone makes life of extremely high significance, even if you don't believe in the significance of life in the traditionally religious sense. Our existence alone is quite miraculous or so it seems.<br><br>
      It wasn't until recently though that I started pondering the ideas
      that <b><em>the human race, along with every other species on the planet, might actually be different hive-minds.</em></b> From my personal perspective, <b><em>the hive-mind would have "motivations" and "ambitions" of its own</em></b> that try to influence the motivations and ambitions of individuals on a grander scale, sometimes making things seem paranormal or "synched up" from our individual perspectives. This could potentially be
      what we call "God". <b><em>"God" could just be the much larger living thing that we all could be a part of</em></b> and some strange and paranormal experiences could just be the psychic phenomena that comes from within us when the hive-mind is trying to communicate something to us.
     </p>
     <h3 id="keepanopenmind">Keep An Open Mind, But Ultimately Decide For Yourself</h3>
     <p>
      I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who would be quick to dismiss such ideas, which is fine because I'm not out
      to change anyone's mind. I'm simply sharing the conclusions I've come to and my personal model of how I think reality might work based on my experiences and the ideas I've explored. My model of reality could very well change tomorrow if presented with new information that seems to fit my personal experiences better.<br><br>
      But the main message I'm trying to portray here is that those who think
      in terms of objective, hard measurements and those who think in terms of subjective experience might not actually be that far and different from each other, in fact it could really be that they compliment each other and the separation of the two is merely an illusion.<br><br>
      If anything, my hope is that this article helps someone else out there who is struggling with conflicting beliefs to
      find spiritual clarity, even if it gets them to consider their own alternatives that better fit to their personal experiences. I find high value in keeping an open mind myself.
