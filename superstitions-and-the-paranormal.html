     <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <p>
      I've always wondered why it is that so many people swear on varying superstitions, even when they don't match
      someone else's version of the same superstition. I mean, I myself have even had a few superstitions that
      I carried faith and conviction in. In fact, there's still one superstition that I don't necessarily carry a ton
      of faith or conviction in but still question to this day when it occurs. It's probably one of the most popular
      superstitions out there: "When your ear rings it means someone is talking shit about you" or "when your ear
      rings someone is talking good about you" and no one can seem to agree on which one it is for which ear. Is it
      the left ear or the right ear? Yet, somehow, some way, many people still hold a lot of faith and conviction in
      this superstition and I can't deny it's hard for me not to question if it's for real when one of my ears starts
      ringing.<br><br>
      One of my other superstitions that I used to hold a lot of faith and conviction in was about dropped
      change. To qualify, the change had to be on the ground if you were outside, or on the floor if you were inside.
      I didn't have a rule for change in a car. The superstition was "If you find change on the ground or floor and
      you pick it up it's good financial luck if the change was heads up, but it's bad financial luck if the change
      was tails up. It's even better financial luck if you pick up tails up change and you leave it heads up
      somewhere for someone else". I've only heard one of my other friends hold a fairly similar superstition, which is
      interesting because I personally thought I made it up. Hah! It's very possible I picked up on it subconsciously
      somewhere along the line though. I never had anyone tell me about that superstition before I believed in it,
      that much I do know. The bad thing about that particular superstition though was that it practically became an
      OCD habit of mine, so I kind of had to put the kabash on it.
