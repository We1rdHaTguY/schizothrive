     <h2>Manifesting Your Thoughts Into Notes</h2>
     <p>
      If you're anything like me, you hate writing things down by hand.
      My preferred method of organizing thoughts into a plan of action is by <b><em>utilizing my phone's notepad.</em></b>
      This method has helped immensely in getting me to keep myself motivated on prospective projects. 
      In fact, <b><em>this very website might have never been</em></b> had I not utilized Moto Notes on my phone daily.
      You don't need anything fancy, just something that allows you to keep notes in as many different categories as you would like to define.
     </p>
     <p>
      These are the current categories I have in my Moto Notes app:
      <div class="info-card">
       <ul>
        <b>
        <li>Positive Actions</li>
        <li>Food Recipes</li>
        <li>Auto-Suggestions</li>
        <li>Blog Ideas</li>
        <li>AI Chat Bot Tasks</li>
        </b>
       </ul>
      </div>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>Positive Actions:</b> This is simply <b><em>a good, low pressure way of keeping me motivated to get things done.</em></b>
      I don't like to schedule chores and other things I need to get done, so rather than make a list of things I need to get done, I strive to have at least a couple "Positive Actions" I can type up on my list each night and the more I have, the better.
      This way I'm not necessarily putting a time constraint or even a structure on getting anything done, but I'm still motivated to get things done because it will just be one more thing I can add to my list of "Positive Actions" at the end of the night.<br><br>
      <b>Food Recipes:</b> Self-explanatory. Just a quick way to reference a recipe when I'm cooking something.
      True cooks like some of my friends would probably giggle at this category; only one recipe resides thus far:<br>The one <a class="pagelinks" href="chatgpt-vegetable-soup-recipe.html">on this site.</a><br><br>
      <b>Auto-Suggestions:</b> These include things like my "Bedtime Affirmations"—self-affirmations I use to help myself fall asleep—and "My Financial Plan" which are my long-term financial goals that I require myself to speak aloud every morning and night.
      <b><em>Having auto-suggestions like this help align your subconscious with your conscious desires</em></b> so that they will become more effortless to achieve. It's a sort of "self-manipulation" of the mind, something I'm often required to do for myself as someone who has schizoaffective disorder. In the case of schizoaffective disorder, I'm using such self-manipulations just to keep myself sane, rather than just help with my daily tasks and overall goals. I'm sure there are some of you out there who could relate. But hey! That's why I'm here! To be a reminder that you're not alone and that we all got this.<br><br>
      <b>Blog Ideas:</b> If I come up with any new ideas throughout the day, I don't hesitate to type them up real quick into a note under this category. <b><em>Writing and typing out your ideas are the first steps of manifesting them into concrete reality.</em></b> At the end of the day, if I don't have three or more blog ideas typed up, I try to come up with at least three, but I don't beat myself up if I miss a day here or there.
      It's important for me to have a natural flow of typing up ideas, even if only briefly. A lot of the ideas I type up may never become fully realized, but <b><em>just having ideas to fall back on or derive new ideas from helps me keep the spark and momentum of creating new content.</em></b><br><br>
      <b>AI Chat Bot Tasks:</b> These are questions, ideas, and tasks that I come up with to be used with a chat bot like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Perplexity. 
      <b><em>Chat bots</em></b> like the three I just mentioned <b><em>have played an important role for me in re-learning HTML and learning CSS to make this very website.</em></b>
      I highly recommend utilizing chat bots in a similar fashion. They're extremely useful for research and for educating yourself.
      I've even used ChatGPT's deep research mode as well as Perplexity to determine roughly what's possible and/or most probable when it comes to making a website like this a successful source of income.
     </p>
     <p>
      These are just the ways that I use my phone's notepad as of now, I'm sure over time I'll think of new and better uses that will help me in even more ways. Try thinking up some of your own little hacks that allow you to keep motivated and increase your productivity!
      You'd be amazed at what making a simple, short list can accomplish!
